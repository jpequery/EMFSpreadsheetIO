#spreadsheet import export

This library consist of a framework to simplify the definition of importer and exporter from XLSX format to EMF model. 

It contains an import/export engine, based on apache POI, and a set of examples, some based on ecore, others on the capella metamodel. It also contains 
a default importer and exporter, based on EMF reflexion API.

This piece of software is based on Apache POI 3.16. An update site with a tested POI can be downloaded on the [M2Doc nightly update site](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/obeo-m2doc-releases/master/nightly/repository). We aim to keep synchonizzed with m2doc for poi usage to ensure the possibility to use both software on the same platform.
