#spreadsheet import export

This library consist of a framework to simplify the definition of importer and exporter from XLSX format to EMF model. 

It contains an import/export engine, based on apache POI, and a set of examples, some based on ecore, others on the capella metamodel. It also contains 
a default importer and exporter, based on EMF reflexion API.

This piece of software is based on Apache POI 3.16. An update site with a tested POI can be downloaded on the [1.1.0 M2Doc update site](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/obeo-m2doc-releases/1.1.0/repository). We aim to keep synchonizzed with m2doc for poi usage to ensure the possibility to use both software on the same platform. 

This piece of software is provided under the [EPL 1.0 Licence](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) and
is developed by Obeo in the context of the [clarity project](http://www.clarity-se.org/)

An installable version of the engine is available as an update site : [version 0.5.0](http://jpequery.free.fr/EMFSpreadsheetIO/0.5.0/).
